**⚠️ STOP - Do not use this template for security vulnerabilities ⚠️**

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** create a public issue.

Instead, please report it privately using one of these methods:

1. **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** (Recommended):
   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/alphacointech1010/debug-glitz/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the form with details

2. **Email**: Contact the maintainers directly (if email is available)

## Why Private Reporting?

Public disclosure of security vulnerabilities can:
- Put users at risk before a fix is available
- Provide attackers with exploit information
- Violate responsible disclosure practices

## What Happens Next?

When you report privately:
- We'll acknowledge your report within 48 hours
- We'll assess and work on a fix
- We'll coordinate with you on disclosure timing
- We'll credit you in our security advisory (if desired)

Thank you for helping keep debug-glitz secure! 🔒
